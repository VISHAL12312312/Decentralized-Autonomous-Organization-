# Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)

## ðŸ§  Project Description

This smart contract implements a basic DAO where registered voters can create proposals, vote on them, and execute decisions based on majority consensus after the voting period ends.

## ðŸ”® Future Scope

- Token-weighted voting mechanism using ERC-20 tokens.
- Integration with Chainlink for automated proposal execution.

- On-chain proposal description storage (IPFS or Arweave).
- Frontend DApp for real-time voting and governance UI.
